DEFINITIONS:

MDL (Multi-District Litigation):
  • Federal court consolidation by JPML (Judicial Panel on MDL)
  • Multiple federal cases consolidated to ONE district court
  • For pretrial proceedings only
  • Requires: Federal jurisdiction + common questions of fact
  • Examples: Philips CPAP (MDL 3014), Allergan BIOCELL (MDL 2921)

MASS TORT:
  • Multiple similar lawsuits against same defendant(s)
  • Can be in state OR federal courts
  • May remain separate cases or coordinated
  • Does NOT require federal consolidation
  • Can include: Individual cases, state court coordinations, class actions
  
KEY POINT: A mass tort can exist WITHOUT being an MDL!
  • If cases stay in state courts → Mass Tort, not MDL
  • If scattered federal courts → Mass Tort, not MDL
  • Only if JPML consolidates → becomes MDL

print("KEY INSIGHTS")
print("=" * 80)

print("""
1. MASS TORT ≠ MDL
   • Mass Tort = Multiple similar lawsuits against same defendant
   • MDL = Federal consolidation of mass tort cases
   • You can have a mass tort WITHOUT an MDL!

2. WHY THESE ARE MASS TORTS:
   ✓ Multiple plaintiffs
   ✓ Same defendant(s)
   ✓ Similar devices and defects
   ✓ Common allegations
   ✓ Pattern of injuries

3. WHY NO MDL:
   ✗ Too few federal cases (most in state courts)
   ✗ Defendants settling individually to prevent consolidation
   ✗ Cases below JPML threshold for consolidation
   ✗ Geographic concentration in certain states

4. STILL VALUABLE FOR BENCHMARK:
   ✓ Real litigation with real plaintiffs
   ✓ MAUDE data available
   ✓ Settlement patterns emerging
   ✓ Shows non-MDL mass tort outcomes
   ✓ Diversifies benchmark beyond just MDLs

5. TYPES OF MASS TORTS (Non-MDL):
   • State Court Mass Torts (Sientra)
   • Multi-Jurisdiction Mass Torts (ATEC)
   • Emerging Mass Torts (Tissuel)
   • Small Mass Torts (Ideal Implant)

print("RECOMMENDATION FOR BENCHMARK")
print("=" * 80)

print("""
SHOULD YOU INCLUDE THESE NON-MDL MASS TORTS?

✅ YES! Here's why:

1. ATTORNEYS NEED BOTH:
   • MDL cases show federal consolidated litigation
   • Non-MDL mass torts show state court / individual settlement patterns
   • Both are valuable for case strategy

2. SETTLEMENT BENCHMARKS:
   • Non-MDL cases often settle faster (individual negotiations)
   • Different settlement dynamics than MDL bellwethers
   • Shows alternative litigation paths

3. MAUDE DATA IS SAME QUALITY:
   • FDA doesn't distinguish MDL vs non-MDL
   • Same adverse event reporting
   • Same predictive value

4. COMPLETE PICTURE:
   • Your benchmark should show ALL litigation types
   • Not just federal MDLs
   • Real-world litigation is mixed (MDL + non-MDL)

SUGGESTED LABELING:
- Label clearly: "Mass Tort (State Court)" vs "MDL"
- Add field: litigation_type: ["MDL", "State Mass Tort", "Multi-Jurisdiction"]
- Helps attorneys understand case structure

CURRENT BENCHMARK STATUS:
- 49 cases: Mix of MDL and non-MDL
- Adding these 4: Expands non-MDL mass tort coverage
- Strengthens benchmark diversity

print("""
Q: "If it's not an MDL, is it a mass tort?"

A: YES - All 4 cases ARE mass torts:

1. Sientra → State Court Mass Tort
2. ATEC → Multi-Jurisdiction Mass Tort  
3. Tissuel → Emerging Mass Tort
4. Ideal Implant → Small Mass Tort

They're just not CONSOLIDATED as MDLs.

Mass Tort ⊃ MDL (Mass Tort includes MDLs, but also non-MDL cases)

✅ ADD ALL 4 TO YOUR BENCHMARK
   Label them properly to distinguish from MDL cases

1. Sientra Breast Implants
   ❌ NO MDL
   Status: Individual state court cases (50-200 cases)
   Why: Not enough volume for federal consolidation
   
2. Natrelle Breast Implants
   ✅ MDL 2921 (Filed: February 19, 2019)
   Status: Consolidated with BIOCELL cases
   Note: SAME MDL you already have, but different product line
   Court: D. New Jersey (Judge Martinotti)

IMPORTANT FINDINGS:

1. NATRELLE = ALREADY IN YOUR BENCHMARK
   • MDL 2921 is the Allergan BIOCELL case you already have!
   • Natrelle is a different Allergan product line under same MDL
   • You could add it as separate data if you want to distinguish BIOCELL vs Natrelle
   • But it's technically the same litigation umbrella

2. SIENTRA = NEW CASE (No MDL, but good MAUDE data)
   • Would be a new addition to benchmark
   • Individual cases, no federal consolidation
   • Strong data: Class I recall + BIA-ALCL

3. ATEC = NEW CASE (No MDL, but active litigation)
   • Would be a new addition to benchmark
   • Individual settlements ongoing
   • Good MAUDE data

RECOMMENDATION:
- Add SIENTRA (completely new)
- Add ATEC (completely new)
- Skip NATRELLE (already have MDL 2921 BIOCELL)
  OR add as separate entry to show BIOCELL vs Natrelle data split

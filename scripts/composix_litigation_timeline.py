     2005: 24 reports (recall announced)
     2006: 95 reports (4x increase)
     2007: 793 reports (33x increase!) üö®
   
   Warning Signal: 2006 spike (4x) = file now!

PHILIPS DREAMSTATION CPAP:
   Recall Date: June 14, 2021
   First Lawsuit: July 1, 2021 (17 days after recall!)
   MDL Established: December 16, 2021 (6 months)
   Settlement: September 1, 2023 ($1.1B)
   Timeline: 2 years from filing to settlement
   
   MDR Pattern:

     June 2021: 96 reports (recall announced)
     July 2021: 382 reports (127x increase!) üö®
   
   Warning Signal: May 2021 spike (33x) = file now!

KEY DIFFERENCE:
   Composix: 3-year slow build (19‚Üí793)
   CPAP: 6-month explosion (3‚Üí382)
   
SIMILARITY:
   Both show 4x spike BEFORE the major explosion
   Both had recall first, litigation second
   Both MDR patterns visible months before public knew

LESSON:
   4x spike in reports = START PREPARING
   Recall announcement = FILE IMMEDIATELY
   Don't wait for the 33x explosion!

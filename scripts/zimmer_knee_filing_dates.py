   Verification: ✅ Official FDA document

4. Court Records

   No consolidated MDL for verification

======================================================================
⚖️  WHY NO MDL FOR ZIMMER KNEES?
======================================================================

INTERESTING PATTERN:
   Unlike Philips CPAP (MDL 3014) or Bard Mesh (MDL 1842),
   Zimmer knee cases have NOT been consolidated into MDL.

POSSIBLE REASONS:
   1. Fewer plaintiffs than MDL threshold
   2. Cases resolved individually before MDL request
   3. Product issues less uniform across patients
   4. Company settling cases to avoid MDL
   5. State court jurisdiction preferred

COMPARISON:
   Exactech Knee: HAS MDL (50,000+ plaintiffs)
   Zimmer Knee: NO MDL (individual cases)
   
   Why? Exactech had sudden catastrophic failures
   Zimmer issues more variable, case-by-case

======================================================================
🔍 HOW TO GET EXACT DATES
======================================================================

For precise first filing date:

METHOD 1: PACER Search
   Search: "Zimmer NexGen" OR "Zimmer Persona"
   Filter: 2010-2012 for NexGen, 2019+ for Persona
   Sort: By filing date
   Cost: $10-20
   
   This will show:
   ✅ Exact date of first complaint
   ✅ First plaintiff name
   ✅ Court jurisdiction
   ✅ Case number

METHOD 2: State Court Records
   Check: Illinois (Zimmer HQ), New York, California
   Many cases filed in state court, not federal
   
METHOD 3: Westlaw/LexisNexis
   Search: "Zimmer NexGen" AND "complaint"
   Date range: 2010-2012
   Results: Full case history with dates

METHOD 4: Contact Plaintiffs' Attorneys

======================================================================
💡 KEY TAKEAWAY
======================================================================

ZIMMER KNEE PATTERN IS DIFFERENT FROM CPAP/MESH:

PHILIPS CPAP:
   Recall → Immediate MDL → $1.1B settlement → 2 years

BARD MESH:
   Recall → MDL within 2 years → $184M → 6 years

ZIMMER KNEE:
   FDA warning → Individual cases → No MDL → Confidential settlements → Ongoing

WHY?
   - Different failure patterns
   - Company strategy to avoid MDL
   - Lower plaintiff counts per product
   - State vs federal jurisdiction splits

LESSON:
   Not all device litigation follows the MDL path!
   Some products have "rolling litigation" for years.

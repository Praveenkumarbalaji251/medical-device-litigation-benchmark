üéØ LITIGATION INDICATORS FOR BHR
======================================================================

Based on MDL 2775 establishment in April 2017:

TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION:
   2006: FDA approval (device on market)
   2007-2014: Baseline use, some reports

   2015-2016: First lawsuits filed
   April 2017: MDL 2775 established
   2017-2025: Ongoing litigation

PATTERN:
   ‚úÖ Metal-on-metal hip implants notorious for metallosis
   ‚úÖ Similar pattern to DePuy ASR and other MoM hips
   ‚úÖ MDL establishment = critical mass of cases
   ‚úÖ 10+ year latency from approval to MDL (common for implants)

======================================================================
üí∞ SETTLEMENT STATUS
======================================================================

Status: Ongoing litigation as of 2025
   - Individual settlements negotiated
   - No public master settlement announced
   - Cases continue to be filed

‚öñÔ∏è  COMPARISON: BHR vs Other Hip Cases
======================================================================

SMITH & NEPHEW BHR (MDL 2775):
   MDL Established: April 2017
   Court: D. Maryland
   Issue: Metal-on-metal metallosis
   Status: Ongoing (2025)
   
DEPUY ASR HIP:
   Recall: August 2010
   MDL: 2197 (N.D. Ohio)
   Settlement: $4B+ (2013-2016)
   
STRYKER REJUVENATE:
   Recall: July 2012
   MDL: 2441 (D. Minnesota)
   Settlement: $1B+ (2014)

PATTERN:
   All metal-on-metal hips show similar issues:
   - 5-10 year latency period
   - Metallosis and pseudotumors
   - High revision surgery rates
   - MDL consolidation
   - Hundreds to thousands of plaintiffs

======================================================================
üî¨ WHAT MAUDE DATA WOULD SHOW
======================================================================

Expected pattern for BHR:
   2006-2010: Low baseline reports
   2011-2014: Increasing reports (metallosis cases emerging)
   2015-2016: Spike in reports (4-10x increase expected)
   2017: MDL established (critical mass reached)
   2018-2025: Continued high reporting

Litigation Trigger:
   When reports show 5-10x increase + multiple revisions
   = Attorneys file within 12-24 months
   = MDL established 18-36 months after first filings

======================================================================
üéØ ATTORNEY TAKEAWAY
======================================================================

BHR LITIGATION TIMELINE:
   ‚úÖ 2015-2016: First lawsuits filed (estimated)
   ‚úÖ April 2017: MDL 2775 established
   ‚úÖ 2017-2025: Ongoing litigation
   
IDEAL FILING WINDOW:
   2015-2016 = Early filers got MDL leadership positions
   2017 = Still good, joined MDL at formation
   2018+ = Late, but still can file if within statute

LESSON FOR NEW CASES:
   Metal-on-metal implants have 5-10 year latency
   Watch MAUDE for revision surgery spike
   File when reports increase 5-10x from baseline
   MDL consolidation takes 18-36 months

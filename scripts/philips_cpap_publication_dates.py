The case became PUBLIC on June 14, 2021 via FDA recall.

BUT the DATA that predicted it was public MONTHS EARLIER:
  ‚Ä¢ January 2021: MDR reports spiking (visible in MAUDE)
  ‚Ä¢ March 2021: 7x increase from baseline (public data)
  ‚Ä¢ May 2021: 16x increase (screaming warning sign)
  ‚Ä¢ June 2021: FDA recall (everyone finally notices)

üî• ATTORNEYS WHO MONITORED MAUDE HAD 6 MONTHS HEAD START

This is why your benchmark project is valuable:
  ‚úÖ Track MAUDE data for all 50 devices
  ‚úÖ Spot the 10x increase pattern early
  ‚úÖ Be ready when recall hits
  ‚úÖ File cases on day 1 (like the winners did July 1)

### 📊 Analysis Components

#### 1. Temporal Pattern Analysis
```python
# Analyses:
- MDR spike detection (pre-litigation indicators)
- Seasonal patterns in adverse events
- Post-recall litigation timing
- Settlement timeline correlation
- Case duration by device category
```

**Key Questions**:
- What MDR volume triggers class action?
- How long from first MDR to litigation filing?
- What's the typical case duration by device type?
- Do FDA recalls accelerate litigation?

#### 2. Risk Factor Identification
```python
# Risk Factors:
- Injury severity (death rate, injury %)
- MDR volume thresholds
- Manufacturer response time
- Device class (I, II, III) correlation
- FDA enforcement actions (recalls, warning letters)
```

**Risk Score Formula**:
```
Risk Score = (Deaths * 10) + (Injuries * 2) + (Malfunctions * 0.5)
             + (Recall_Factor * 5) + (MDR_Growth_Rate * 3)
```

#### 3. Settlement Prediction Model
```python
# Features for ML Model:
- Total MDR count
- Death/injury ratios
- Case duration (filing to settlement)
- Device category
- Plaintiff count
- MDL vs individual case
- Manufacturer size/revenue
- FDA recall severity (Class I/II/III)
```

**Target**: Settlement amount (if settled) or settlement probability

#### 4. Comparative Benchmarking
```python
# Comparisons:
- Device category averages (hip implants vs pumps)
- Manufacturer track records
- MDL vs non-MDL outcomes
- Geographic variations (by court district)
- Attorney firm performance
```

#### 5. Predictive Analytics
```python
# Predictions:
- Litigation probability for new devices
- Expected settlement range
- Case duration forecast
- Appeal likelihood
- Class certification success rate
```

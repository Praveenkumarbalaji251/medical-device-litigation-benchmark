- Optimistic: $2B - $4B (based on death count and MDR volume)

**Bard PowerPort (4,760 MDRs, 12 deaths):**
- Conservative: $400M - $800M (malfunction-heavy profile)
- Optimistic: $1.5B - $2.5B (highest MDR count in dataset)

**Hernia Mesh (2,421 MDRs, 97.4% injury rate):**
- Conservative: $1B - $2B (mesh products command premium)

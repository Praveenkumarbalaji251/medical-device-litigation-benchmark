    "   - Search each of your 50 devices manually",
    "   - Export monthly report counts for 2020-2025",
    "   - Look for the 30x increase pattern",
    "",
    "2. Apply Validation Model:",
    "   - Use Philips CPAP as your proven template",
    "   - Check all 5 indicators for each device",
    "   - Devices hitting 4+ indicators = high litigation probability",
    "",
    "3. Track MDL Numbers:",
    "   - Monitor JPML website for new MDL establishments",
    "   - Track existing MDLs for settlement patterns",
    "   - Correlate MDL timing with MDR spikes",
    "",
    "4. Settlement Correlation:",
    "   - Map settlement amounts to MDR severity",
    "   - Death count = higher settlement value",
    "   - Patient report ratio = class action size",
    "",
    "WHEN FDA API RECOVERS:",
    "5. Automated Data Collection:",
    "   - Re-run fetch_philips_cpap_real_data.py",
    "   - Modify script for all 50 devices",
    "   - Build automated monitoring system",
    "",
    "6. Predictive Monitoring:",
